Creation of hybrid application â€“ National Groundwater Arsenic Monitoring network.
The idea is to develop a website as well as a mobile application to create awareness about arsenic contamination in ground water with the available data provided by the central ground water board. Also the grievances met out in this regard & various schemes initiated by central ground water board in providing quality drinking water will be advertised.
